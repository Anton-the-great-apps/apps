        "DO NOT GO TO MT. HUGH!
        <br>
        <br>
        This town is full of mean and insane people. I've never seen such a collection of rude, hostile, and downright crazy individuals in my life. I've been here for two days, and I've already had more than enough.
        <br>
        <br>
        The first day, I went to the grocery store to buy some food. I was minding my own business, picking out some apples, when this woman comes up to me and starts yelling at me for no reason. She called me a bunch of names and accused me of stealing her car. I was so shocked and scared that I just ran away.
        <br>
        <br>
        The next day, I went to the park to relax. I was sitting on a bench, reading a book, when this guy comes up to me and starts talking to me about aliens. He said that the government is hiding the truth about aliens, and that they're going to take over the world soon. I tried to ignore him, but he wouldn't leave me alone. He kept following me around, talking about aliens and conspiracy theories.
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm so glad I'm leaving this town tomorrow. I can't wait to get away from these crazy people. If you're thinking about visiting Mt. Hugh, don't do it! It's not worth it."
